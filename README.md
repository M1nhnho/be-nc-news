## Setup
In order to connect to the databases, 2 files must be created in the root directory:
- `.env.test`
- `.env.development`

Then add this single line to each file:  
`PGDATABASE=<database_name>`

Replace `<database_name>` with the appropriate name (these can be found in the `setup.sql` file).
